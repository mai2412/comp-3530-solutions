# COMP3530 Solutions
A place to share solutions for COMP3530 tutorials.

## Contributing

If you have solutions to contribute, add them to the markdown file for the corresponding week. If your solution is the same as someone else's, but you have more detail to add, feel free to do so. Alternatively, if your solution is different, feel free to add it to the file but keep other solutions unmodified. This way people can compare solutions, and see where people might have made mistakes.

Once you have some solutions to add to the repo, feel free to make a pull request; I'll try to get around to approving them as quickly as I can. If you've got any questions feel free to contact me :)
